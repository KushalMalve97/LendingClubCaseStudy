## General Information
```
Lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss
(called credit loss). The credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender 
when the borrower refusesto pay or runs away with the money owed.  

The main objective is to be able to identify these risky loan applicants, 
then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. 
Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study. 
  
Perform an analysis to understand the driving factors (or driver variables)
behind loan default, i.e.the variables which are strong indicators of default.  
The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.

## Conclusions
- Loans having higher interest rate have more  defaulters. Check the background of applicant  thoroughly if interest rate is high.
- Most probable defaulters can be applicants who have 10+ experience. Check the background of applicant  thoroughly if employment length is high.
- Most of the applicants with annual income between 60-70k are defaulters. This income can be tricky as it can suited for high graded as well low graded loans. Check   the capability before offering loans.
- When the purpose of loan is debt consolidation check applicant thoroughly as it has high tendency to default.
- The interest rate for charged off loans is pretty high than that of fully paid loans in all the loan amount groups. 
- When the applicants are living in a rented house, they have a high tendency to default. Lending club can avoid/reduce offering loans to such applicants.
